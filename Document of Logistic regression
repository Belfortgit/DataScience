Customer Churn Prediction: Model Exploration and Evaluation
This report analyzes customer churn in a telecommunications company using a Logistic Regression model. It details the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering techniques, evaluation results, and potential challenges encountered during the project.

Model Used: Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a well-suited algorithm for binary classification tasks like churn prediction. It estimates the probability of an event (churning in this case) occurring based on a set of independent variables (customer features). The model outputs a value between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating a greater likelihood of churn.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Correlation Matrix: Analyzing correlations between features revealed relationships that might influence churn. For example, a high correlation between "PhoneService" and "InternetService" suggests customers with both services might be less likely to churn.
Churn by Contract Type: Visualizing churn distribution across contract types (monthly, yearly, etc.) identified contracts with higher churn rates. This information can be used to target specific customer segments with retention strategies.
Feature Engineering

A new feature, "TotalServices", was created by summing up service-related features. This combined feature provides insights into the relationship between the number of subscribed services and churn propensity.

Evaluation Results

The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics:

Accuracy: Measures overall prediction correctness.
Precision: Identifies the proportion of correctly predicted churners among all predicted churners.
Recall: Identifies the proportion of actual churners correctly predicted by the model.
F1-Score: A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced view of model performance.
Confusion Matrix: Visualizes how many predictions fell into each category (true positive, false positive, etc.).
ROC Curve: The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve helps assess the model's ability to discriminate between churners and non-churners. Analyzing the Area Under the Curve (AUC) provides a measure of this discrimination ability.
Challenges Faced

Imbalanced Data: The number of churned customers might be significantly lower than non-churned customers, leading to imbalanced data. This can impact model performance, requiring techniques like oversampling or undersampling to address the imbalance.
Missing Data: Handling missing data effectively is crucial. Depending on the extent and nature of missing values, imputation techniques or data removal might be necessary.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Tuning the hyperparameters of the Logistic Regression model (e.g., regularization parameters) can significantly improve its performance.
Conclusion

This project explored customer churn prediction using Logistic Regression. The analysis identified potential relationships between features and churn, and the model achieved a baseline performance for identifying at-risk customers. Addressing challenges like data imbalance and hyperparameter tuning can further enhance the model's accuracy and effectiveness in real-world applications.
